# EDA and Hypothesis Testing of Titanic Survival by Gender

This project explores who was more likely to survive the Titanic disaster, with a special focus on differences between men and women.

## What this project shows

- How survival varies by:
  - Gender (male vs female)
  - Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
  - Age group (children, adults, seniors)
  - Family size (alone vs with family)
  - Ticket fare (as a proxy for socio-economic status)

- Whether the difference in survival between men and women is large enough to be considered statistically significant.

## Key interpretations

- **Gender:** Women had a much higher survival rate than men, reflecting “women and children first” evacuation priorities.
- **Class:** Passengers in 1st class survived more often than those in 2nd and especially 3rd class, showing a clear link between socio-economic status and safety.
- **Age:** Children had better chances of survival than adults and seniors, again consistent with evacuation priority.
- **Family:** People traveling completely alone tended to survive less than those in small families, suggesting that having companions may have helped in reaching lifeboats.
- **Fare / Cabin:** Higher ticket fares and having an assigned cabin are both associated with better survival outcomes, reinforcing the role of wealth and privilege.

- **Hypothesis test:** A formal comparison of male vs female survival rates confirms that the gap is not due to random chance; gender had a strong, statistically significant impact on survival.
